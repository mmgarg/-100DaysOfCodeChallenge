Topic of the day: Java List
List in Java provides the facility to maintain the ordered collection. It contains the index-based methods to insert, update, delete and search the elements. It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, N(the initial number of elements in L).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing L.
The third line contains an integer, Q (the number of queries).
The 2Q subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:

If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space separated integers xy, and the value y must be inserted into L at index .
If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index x, whose element must be deleted from L.

Output Format
Print the updated list L as a single line of space-separated integers.
