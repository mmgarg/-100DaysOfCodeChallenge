Question: USE A, B & N TO CREATE A SERIES
(a+2^0.b),(a+2^0.b+2^1.b),......(a+2^0.b+2^1.b+......+2^n-1.b)

We use the integers a ,b , and n  to create the following series:

You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai, bi, and ni  values for that query.

Constraints:
0<=q<=500
0<=a,b<=50
1<=n<=15

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Sample Input

2
0 2 10
5 3 5
Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
Explanation

We have two queries:

We use a=0,b=2 , and n=10  to produce some series :
s0=0+1.2=2
s1=0+1.2+2.2=6
s2=0+1.2+2.2+4.2=14
... and so on.

Once we hit n=10, we print the first ten terms as a single line of space-separated integers.

We use a=5,b=3 , and n=5 to produce some series :
s0=5+1.3=8
s1=5+1.3+2.3=14
and so on
We then print each element of our series as a single line of space-separated values.
