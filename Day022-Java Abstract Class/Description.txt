Topic Of the Day: Java Abstract Class
A Java abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated. That means you cannot create new instances of an abstract class. It works as a base for subclasses.

Example of abstract class:
abstract class Book{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}
Input
A tale of two cities

Output
The title is: A tale of two cities
