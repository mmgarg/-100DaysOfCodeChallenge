📌TOPIC: JAVA IF ELSE STATEMENTS
📌LANGUAGE USED: JAVA
In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

📌Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, .

📌Constraints: 1<=n<=100

📌Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

📌Sample Input 0: 3
📌Sample Output 0: Weird
📌Sample Input 1: 24
📌Sample Output 1: Not Weird

📌Explanation

Sample Case 0 : n=3
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: n=24
n>24 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
