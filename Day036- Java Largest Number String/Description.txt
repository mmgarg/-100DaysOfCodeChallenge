Problem: A list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it. Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"

Testcase:
 Input
[10,2]
[3,30,34,5,9]
Output
"210"
"9534330"
Expected
"210"
"9534330"

Explanation:
1.	First convert given array of integer values to array of string values
2.	Next sort the values by their alphanumeric values in a combination where:
3.	b + a and a + b are compared
4.	here b + a refers to b-string concatenated with a-string
5.	a and b refers to string values in the array
