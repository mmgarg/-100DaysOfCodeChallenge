📌TOPIC: JAVA LOOP I
📌LANGUAGE USED: JAVA
📌Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

📌Task
Given an integer,N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N x i(where 1<=i<=10 ) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

📌Input Format
A single integer,N .

📌Constraints: 2<=N<=20

📌Output Format
Print 10 lines of output; each line i(where 1<=i<=10 ) contains the result of N x i in the form:
N x i = result.

📌Sample Input: 2
📌Sample Output
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20
