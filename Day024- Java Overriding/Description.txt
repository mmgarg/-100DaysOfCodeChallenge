Topic Of The Day:Java Method Overriding
When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it also inherits its methods; however, it can also override the superclass methods (as well as declare and implement new ones). 
 When overriding a method, you should precede it with the @OverRide annotation. The parameter(s) and return type of an overridden method must be exactly the same as those of the method inherited from the supertype.
