Topic of the day: Java Basic Calculator (String)
Problem: A string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. The integer division should truncate toward zero. We may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

Example 1:
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7

Example 2:
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1

Testcase:
Your input: "3+2*2"
" 3/2 "
" 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 7
1
5
Expected: 7
1

Explanation:
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string. The expression string contains only non-negative integers, 4 operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.
