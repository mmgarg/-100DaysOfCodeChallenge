Topic of the Day: Java Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
QUESTION: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once

Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

TESTCASES:
Input: nums =[1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Expected: [1,2]

LOGIC:
1. Check if the current and the next element are equal.
2. If they are, we will skip the next element and will continue the procedure as long as we encounter the duplicates.
3. If the elements are not duplicate, we will place the next (different) element next to the current element.
