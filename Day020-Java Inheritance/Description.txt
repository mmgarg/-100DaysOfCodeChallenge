Topic of the Day:Java Inheritance
Using inheritance, one class can acquire the properties of others.
Steps:
1.This class has only one method, walk. 
2.Next, we want to create a Bird class that also has a fly method. We do this using extends keyword.
3.Finally, we can create a Bird object that can both fly and walk.
Output:
I am walking
I am flying
I am singing
